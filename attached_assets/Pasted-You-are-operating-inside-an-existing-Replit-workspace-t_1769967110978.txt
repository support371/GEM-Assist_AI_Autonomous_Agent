You are operating inside an existing Replit workspace that already contains a working autonomous agent core (multi-step planner + executor).

Your task is to FINALIZE this project into a production-grade autonomous AI system by implementing ALL of the following, without breaking existing functionality.

GOALS (DO ALL):

1. TOOLS
- Implement a tool registry the agent can use autonomously.
- Include at minimum:
  - read_file
  - write_file
  - list_files
  - fetch_url
- Tools must be callable by the agent via structured actions.
- Tools must log inputs and outputs.

2. MEMORY (PERSISTENT)
- Add persistent memory that survives restarts.
- Use a simple local store (JSON or lightweight file-based DB).
- Memory must record:
  - completed tasks
  - decisions
  - results
- Memory must be injected into planning and execution prompts.

3. SELF-REFLECTION
- After each task execution, run a reflection step.
- Reflection must answer:
  - Was the task completed successfully?
  - What should be improved?
  - Should the agent retry, adjust, or proceed?
- Reflection must influence the next action.

4. AUTONOMOUS BOOT
- Add an autonomous mode that can start without user input.
- On startup:
  - Load previous memory
  - Resume unfinished goals if any
- UI should allow switching between:
  - Manual goal entry
  - Autonomous continuous mode

5. BOOST (RELIABILITY & CONTROL)
- Add execution safeguards:
  - Max steps per run
  - Graceful failure handling
  - Clear agent state reporting
- Ensure the agent never enters infinite loops.

6. UI MATCH + LIVE PREVIEW
- Improve the UI to resemble a modern agent dashboard:
  - Chat / task log
  - Agent status (Planning / Executing / Reflecting)
  - Current task highlight
- IMPORTANT:
  - Enable Replit LIVE PREVIEW
  - Ensure the preview updates so the user can watch the agent run in real time
  - The workspace must clearly show the development process and output

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT rewrite the entire project.
- Extend the existing agent core.
- Keep the system understandable and modular.
- Prefer clarity and reliability over extra features.

DELIVERABLE:
- A fully working autonomous AI agent with:
  - tools
  - memory
  - self-reflection
  - autonomous mode
  - live preview UI
- The project must run cleanly in Replit and be viewable via Live Preview.

Proceed step by step, implementing, testing, and enabling Live Preview.
